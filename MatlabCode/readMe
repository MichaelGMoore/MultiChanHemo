% Script to train spatial model on GFP training data and compare results
% with non-spatial Beer-Lambert models

% Models:

% PWR - Pixelwise Regression
%   PWR_1       each reflectance channel regressed from fluor channel
%   PWR         all reflectance channels regressed from fluor channel

% BLR - Beer-Lambert Regression 
%   BLR_DWA     discrete-wavelength approximation
%   BLR_CW      continuuous-wavelength Beer-Lambert model

% SMR - Spatial Model Regression
%   SMR_1       Training and testing spatial-model on a single animal
%   SMR_CV      Leave-one-animal-out cross-validation of spatial model
%   SMR         model trained on all GFP animals for use on GCaMP animals

% This project takes the following inputs from the user: 

%   Beer-Lambert inputs:
%       -Spectra for each reflectance channel
%       -excitation and emission spectra for each fluor channel

%   Spatial Model inputs:
%       -video for each channel from several GFP animals

% Data Preparation Guidelines:

%   Each imaging session stored as HDF5 file with '.h5' extension, and with 
%   the specified schema.

%   All training GFP imaging session .h5 files are together in a single 
%   directory 
%       No other files are in this directory

%   h5 schema:

%       Spectral data:
%           -datasets stored under group '/spectra'
%           -Fluorescence spectra:
%               excitation:  '/spectra/Fex' or '/spectra/F1ex' 
%               emission:    '/spectra/Fem' or '/spectra/F1em'
%           -Additional fluorophores
%               '/spectra/F2ex' and 'spectra/F2em' and so on

%           -Reflectance channels:
%               '/spectra/R1' and 'spectra/R2' and so on

%           -Number of reflectance channels
%               -If number of reflectance channels = 1, only one
%               dimension of Hb dynamics can be removed
%               -If number of reflectance channels > 2, least squares will
%               be used to infer HbO and HbR fluctuations
      
%           -each spectra given as [N x 2] array (N is number of wavelengths sampled)
%               col 1 for wavelengths in nm
%               col 2 for spectral weights
%           -spectra need not be normalized
%           -N need not be the same for each spectra

%       Imaging data:
%           -datasets stored under group'/images'
%           
%           -Fluorescence channel video:
%               '/images/F' or 'images/F1'
%           -additional Fluorescence channels
%               '/images/F2' and so on
%           -Reflectance channel videos
%               '/images/R1' and '/images/R2' and so on
%
%           -Images stored as 3-dimensional arrays, with 3rd dimension 
%           being the time dimension 
%           -Videos from different channels are aligned spatially and 
%           temporally, no additional alignment will be performed

%       Additional Attributes
%            '/animalID' and '/sessionID' unique identifiers are required
